tips from a reddit god:
There are lots of different git workflows. I find it works best to create a feature branch from
master. On the branch, do all your coding and testing. Push youur branc. Next merge origin/master into
your branch to resolve conflicts. (in case you goof up, you still have master). Once conflicts are resolved,
merge your branch into origin/master. Rinse and repeat!
